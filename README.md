# Robot-dance
This repository contains the Arduino code for a robot that performs choreographed dance moves based on a series of grid-based instructions. The robot interprets coordinates and movement commands to execute a synchronized dance routine.

Key Features:
Grid-Based Choreography: Dance moves are defined by a sequence of (x, y) coordinates or directional commands (e.g., forward, turn, spin).

Modular Code Structure: Easy to modify and extend for different dance routines.

Real-Time Execution: The robot processes instructions step-by-step for smooth performance.

Example Routines: Includes pre-programmed dance sequences for quick testing.

Use Cases:
Educational robotics projects

Entertainment & performances

Interactive art installations
